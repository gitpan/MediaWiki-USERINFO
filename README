NAME
    MediaWiki::USERINFO - Parse the USERINFO/ files in MediaWiki's
    Subversion repository

DESCRIPTION
    MediaWiki's subversion repository contains a USERINFO
    <http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/USERINFO/> directory. This
    module knows how to parse files therein, look up usernames (or aliases),
    de-obfuscate the "email:" field in the USERINFO files and more.

    See the t/userinfo.t test file in the distribution for what it can do.
    This module was mainly written to find out what users were missing
    USERINFO files (or essential fields) for the proposed MediaWiki -> Git
    conversion.

    This module can generate a program to be used with "git filter-branch
    --env-filter" to rename svn users in a "git svn" generated MediaWiki
    repository to real names/email pairs.
